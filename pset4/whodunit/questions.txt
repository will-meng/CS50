1.  stdint.h is a header file that defines typedefs for data types of specific widths
2.  These types are useful when writing portable code that might be compiled differently on different machines, as they have explicit sizes/widths.
3.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes
4.  ASCII - BM, Hex - 424d, Dec - 6677
5.  bfSize refers to the bitmap's entire filesize in bytes (246 for smiley.bmp) while biSize refers to just the bi header's size (40 bytes)
6.  bitmap is a top-down DIB and origin is the upper left corner
7.  biBitCount
8.  The file might not exist or might have protections preventing read access
9.  Because the headers of each bitmap only need to be copied once into the structures
10. 4 - (3*3)%4 = 3
11. fseek changes the current offset of the file pointer
12. SEEK_CUR means offset is in relation to its current position (as opposed to the beginning or end of the file)
